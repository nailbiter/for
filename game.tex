\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	\begin{block}{}It is well-known that learning languages is difficult. \end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{}This requires\begin{itemize}
		\item Memory \item Diligence \item Regular practice \item \textbf{Motivation}\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	\begin{block}{}
		It is difficult for both adults and children.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{}
		And high school education does not make situation better.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{}
		In many countries, the English classes in high school, despite being mandatory, are one of the most
		\red{inefficient} ways to learn language.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{}
		Seemingly disproving the fact that children are inherently good language learners.
	\end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	\begin{center}{\Huge Imagine at the moment...}\end{center}
	\pause
	\begin{center}{\huge That the language learning would be delivered as a \red{game}}\end{center}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\large
		\item<1-> And learners would get interactive and up-to-date environment instead of boring textbook.
		\item<2-> They would \red{want} to memorize words and sentences, want to discover new words.
		\item<3-> Learning would not be limited to 2 hours in classroom, but instead learners will come back again and again.
		\item<4-> Learners can associate the words in their vocabulary with bright images of the game.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Gameplay}
Inspired by Heroes of Might and Magic.\\\pause
Turn-based. Heroes move along the map and engage in \red{fight}. \\\pause
During the fight, magician can cast spells and summon creatures.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Gameplay}
	\begin{center}{\Large The \red{key point}}\end{center}\pause 
	\begin{center}Everything is done by \textit{just} pronouncing the name of the action\end{center}\pause
	\begin{center}But you should know that name\end{center}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Gameplay}
	\begin{block}{}With each spell/summon some portion of magical energy -- \textit{breath}, is spent\end{block}\pause
	\begin{block}{}The mispronounced word will result in breath wasted, in exchange for weakened/funnily deformed creatures
	\end{block}\pause
	\begin{block}{}Thus we have motivation to \red{not} to make mistakes\end{block}\pause
	\begin{block}{}As more difficult words/phrases you know, as more complicated and strong magic you can make\end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Features}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\large
		\item Built-in speech recognition facility helps to "understand" what player says. In case accent, grammar and word
			are all correct, magic is successfully applied.
		\item Player can learn from enemies during the battle, as he can hear what they say. Alternatively, for payment
			merchant at the shop will pronounce the name requested. As you pay for this, you will be \red{urged} to
			memorize.
		\item Mistakes in pronunciation/accent lead to comically deformed creatures and wasted breath --  so in order to win,
			you should speak perfectly.
		\item All aspects of language: writing, reading, speaking and listening are exercised.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Features}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\large
		\item Landscape during the battle is destroyable or can be changed as an aftereffect of the magic applied.
		\item \red{(!)} Initial location and weather depend on weather in gamer's \red{real} geographic location.
		\item Game can be played from any device (e.g. smartphone).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%Features of the game:
%*) Speech recognition
%*) Unique teaching method: can learn from enemies or shops
%*) Time for speaking on each step is reduced as complexity increases
%*) Mistakes in pronunciation lead to deformed/weakened creatures or unsuccessful magic, AI and merchants at shops talk beautifully,
	%so player can learn
%*) Mistakes in grammar lead to deformed/weakened creatures or unsuccessful magic

%*) Landscape is destroyable and changeable by player's actions
%*) *Location appear and weather depends on current weather in player's location*
%*) (Winner/Loser should repair the location)

%*) *Playing from another device*
