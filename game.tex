		\item<1-> And learners would get interactive and up-to-date environment instead of boring textbook.
		\item<2-> They would \red{want} to memorize words and sentences, want to discover new words.
		\item<3-> Learning would not be limited to 2 hours in classroom, but instead learners will come back again and again.
		\item<4-> Yes, it will be fun to play

%Features of the game:
%1) Speech recognition
%2) Landscape is destroyable and changeable by player's actions
%3) Unique teaching method: can learn from enemies or shops
%4) Time for speaking on each step is reduced as complexity increases
%5) Mistakes in grammar lead to deformed/weakened creatures or unsuccessful magic
%6) Mistakes in pronunciation lead to deformed/weakened creatures or unsuccessful magic, AI and merchants at shops talk beautifully,
%so player can learn
%7) *Playing from another device*
%8) *Location appear and weather depends on current weather in player's location*
%9) (Winner/Loser should repair the location)
