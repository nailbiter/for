  <with|font-series|bold|What has been done (additional)>

  <\enumerate>
    <item>With a lot of help from You prepared the abstract for the
    Functional Analysis Symposium on August 21;

    <item>Based on the experience of my last two talks I have modified the
    <verbatim|reflection.pdf> (reflection on my last RIMS talk on integral
    formula) and <verbatim|checklist.pdf> (list of items to check when
    preparing for a speech);

    <item>For most of the items in the bibliography list of the Symposium's
    abstract I was able to find corresponding hyperlinks. I have attached
    these as <verbatim|bibliography.pdf>. Please check it if You have
    time;<\footnote>
      Should I rather provide a link to article's \Pofficial webpage\Q, or
      the place where one can see the actual content?
    </footnote>

    <item>By reading the resulting abstract and by reading Your emails to
    Prof. Nagisa I have learned several useful words and expressions: these
    are reflected in <verbatim|vocab_oral.pdf> and
    <verbatim|vocab_written.pdf>;<\footnote>
      Items 4, 5, 6 of this list are not done yet (hence, please ignore the
      files <verbatim|vocab_written.pdf>, <verbatim|vocab_oral.pdf>,
      <verbatim|lecture.pdf> and <verbatim|manner-jap.pdf> for now). I will
      send them before the end of Saturday. I am extremely sorry.
    </footnote>

    <item>By reading Your emails to Prof. Nagisa I have learned something
    about writing emails. The things I have learned are described in
    <verbatim|manner-jap.pdf>;

    <item>I have attended Your lecture on July 19th for undergraduate
    students. It was very enlightening. My lecture notes are attached as
    <verbatim|lecture.pdf>.
  </enumerate>

  <with|font-series|bold|What I plan to do during this week>:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>Prove the multiplicity-freeness of
    <math|<big|wedge><rsup|i><around*|(|\<bbb-S\><rsup|p>\<times\>\<bbb-S\><rsup|q>;\<bbb-C\>|)>>
    as representation of <math|O<around*|(|p+1|)>\<times\>O<around*|(|q+1|)>>;

    <item>Reading:

    <\enumerate>
      <item>Finish reading <cite|lang2012sl2>;

      <item>Start reading <cite|vogan1987unitary> or
      <cite|vogan1981representations> (see the Question <reference|q:vogan>
      below)
    </enumerate>

    <item>Practice the speeches from the Mathematical Society meeting on
    March and Representation Theory Symposium in Okinawa, so to be able to
    recite them from \ memory;
  </enumerate>

  <\with|font-series|bold>
    Questions
  </with>

  <\enumerate>
    <item>I still have to decide the topic of my report for Tambara. I see
    the following possibilities:

    <\enumerate>
      <item>I could make a talk about my own results. If I try hard enough, I
      may to be able to get some interesting results regarding the
      multiplicity-freeness of the space of differential forms
      <math|\<Omega\><rsup|i><around*|(|\<bbb-S\><rsup|p>\<times\>\<bbb-S\><rsup|q>/\<pm\>,\<bbb-C\>|)>>
      as <math|O<around*|(|p+1|)>\<times\>O<around*|(|q+1|)>>-module.

      <item>I could make a survey of a paper(s). Perhaps, it would be
      interesting to prepare some material about Gross-Prasad conjecture and
      how it relates to Your recent results with Professor Speh. For the
      latter I plan to use Your article <cite|kobayashi2017symmetry>. For
      more background on the conjecture itself, I plan to talk to Atobe-san
      in Kurashiki next week, so he will recommend me some books.
    </enumerate>

    Which one would You prefer?

    <item>When You talked to me last Friday You told me that I might have
    lost my chances of finding a job immediately after PhD's graduation. This
    perspective (of not being able to find a job) really worries me. I would
    be extremey grateful if You would outline steps I need to carry out in
    order to bring my chances back (points about <with|font-series|bold|not>
    carrying friends to my talks and <with|font-series|bold|not> being late
    to lectures together with other points in <verbatim|checklist.pdf> and
    <verbatim|reflection.pdf> are noted).

    <item><label|q:vogan>When You talked to me in Your office on Friday, I
    remember that You told me to read Vogan's book on \Prepresentations of
    Lie groups\Q in order to deepen my understanding of
    <math|A<rsub|\<frak-q\>><around*|(|\<lambda\>|)>>-modules. More
    precisely, did You meant <cite|vogan1987unitary> or
    <cite|vogan1981representations>?

    <item>Thank You once again for allowing me to listen to Your Wednesday's
    lecture. It was very enlightening, but I have a few questions regarding
    to it. Please see <verbatim|lecture.pdf>.

    <item>In one of the letters I have read, written by You, there were a
    following passage:<math|>

    <item><math|\<#95A2\>\<#6570\>> vs <math|\<#51FD\>\<#6570\>>.

    <item>when should I write in kanji/katakana
  </enumerate>

  <paragraph|Comments>

  Let me again express my gratitude for You spending so much time, energy and
  effort in helping me preparing the abstract for Functional Analysis
  Symposium. I am extremely sorry for my sloppiness and slowness. I will put
  effort to improve myself.
