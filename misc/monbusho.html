Introduction
The subject of my master thesis (in prep.) is a study of symmetry breaking operators (SBO) between induced representations of G=O(p+1,q) and G’=O(p,q) corresponding to induction from maximal parabolic subgroup, parametrized each by one complex parameter. The case q=1 is the subject of papers [KS1] and [KS2] by Toshiyuki Kobayashi and Birgit Speh, which besides introduced several techniques of varying generality for dealing with of symmetry breaking in orthogonal groups, which are extensively employed in my work. Already in [KS1] the case q=1 was shown to be connected with numerous mathematical objects and theories (e.g. Juhl conformal equivariant operators, Knapp-Stein operators, de-Sitter spaces, harmonic analysis, branching laws of complementary series, etc.)
The general problem of finding symmetry breaking operators between representations of reductive groups, as set up by professor Kobayashi, has relation to a wide range of fields, including not only representation theory, but also geometry and number theory. In particular, study of SBOs of O(p,q) includes theory of trilinear forms for representations of SL2 (from representation theory), as one might see latter as SBOs of O(2,2)>O(2,1). Moreover, based on the viewpoint introduced in [KP], one may see the Rankin-Cohen brackets (which in turn were originally introduced for the study of modular forms in number theory, but since then were seen to have connections with covariant quantization and ring structures on representations spaces) as (being almost the same as) differential symmetry breaking operators of O(2,2)>O(2,1) branching, which in turn is a special case of SBOs of O(p,q).
Research status
The (quite general) techniques introduced in [KS1] and [KS2] allow one to reduce problem of finding SBOs of reductive groups to that of finding generalized functions on Euclidean space (the kernels of SBOs, given by Schwartz kernel theorem) that satisfy system of PDEs and some invariance conditions. Additional information is provided by the fact that the geometry of orbit decomposition of flag manifold of G under the action of P’ (maximal parabolic subgroup of G’) implies that these distributions may only have some predetermined supports (finitely many, 8 for generic p,q). Latter problem of finding such generalized functions can then be attacked by a wide range of techniques from analysis, including theory of partial differential equations, generalized functions and generalized functions depending on meromorphic parameter, the latter connecting us with the theory of meromorphic functions and complex analysis and allowing one to employ striking properties of the latter, the most notable being rigidity of meromorphic functions. As the solution space of equations on Euclidean space mentioned above forms finite-dimensional vectors space, one is also interested in finding explicit formulas for basis elements of it.
In the course of my work, I was able to:
1.	understand the geometry of orbit decomposition of flag variety of G under the action of P’ (maximal parabolic subgroup of G’), in particular compute the number of orbits for every p,q and characterize them geometrically;
2.	normalize kernels of the three (out of four) families of SBOs for O(p+1,q)>O(p,q) branching, including differential operators. The four families mentioned span solution space in the sense that for every value of parameters one might find basis for solution space with basis elements belonging every to these families with no two belonging to the same family. The families, in turn, are characterized by the support of kernels. In particular, one family consists of kernel of differential SBOs, and is supported at origin, while other two are supported on subsets of Euclidean space and corresponds to kernels of singular SBOs – all these families are one-dimensional for codimension 1 subset of parameter space and vanish otherwise. This is in perfect agreement with the fact that dimension of SBOs is generically one;
3.	draw complete classification of these three families (including explicit formulae for kernels, normalization and determination of support for every value of parameters);
4.	mimicking various computations done in [KS1], in particular finding explicit form of K-finite vectors under action of K on G/P flag manifold, giving explicit formula for parametrization of open Bruhat cell, setting up the system of equations that characterize kernels of SBOs in non-compact picture;
5.	during my study in Tokyo University I finished a paper “A new criterion for the roughness of exponential dichotomy on R” (joint w. Petro Feketa, to appear).
Research plan
Unfortunately, kernel of regular SBO attempts to be more difficult to normalize and investigate, and thus it forms a natural basis for a future work. Having normalized all other SBOs and seeing them as residues of regular SBO (which is done with the help of residue formula one can write), with some much effort one might be able to normalize regular SBO as well. Moreover, structure of poles appears to be simple and similar to that of other three families.
Besides that, other further possible directions are as follows:
1.	one might try to solve similar problem, instead taking the induction from minimal parabolic subgroup, thus arriving at principal series. Computations appear to be more complicated, as number of cosets P’/G/P increases with p and q, but still might be manageable;
2.	one might ask similar question for other pairs of (reductive) groups (as techniques of [KS1] and [KS2] in fact apply to a wide range of problems). In particular, symmetry breaking between infinite-dimensional representations of general linear groups GL(n) and GL(n-1) and orthogonal O(n) and O(n-1) will be of interest related to study of automorphic forms in number theory.
