    <p>
      In the field of representation theory one can roughly be said to
      studying objects (representations) and morphisms between them (symmetry
      breaking operators). Now, while the former has been well studied for
      more than 70 years with some fairly good classification results
      available at this point, the latter has attracted attention only
      relatively recently with general theory introduced no earlier than
      around 1990. The most fundamental case is that of symmetry breaking
      between the pair of reductive groups; however, the symmetry breaking in
      this case is known to be difficult. The first example of complete
      classification was accomplished only recently in [<a href="#bib-kobayashi2015symmetry">KS15</a>] by
      T. Kobayashi and B. Speh. Their work was immediately followed by Clerk
      (France), &Oslash;rsted (Denmark), M&uuml;llers and Gomez (USA) among
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general problem of symmetry breaking between reductive groups, as
      led by professor Kobayashi, besides being fundamental in representation
      theory, is also known to interact with geometry, PDE, real analysis and
      number theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="auto-2"></a><h6>My research status</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of my master thesis (in prep.) is a study of symmetry
      breaking operators (SBO), that is G'-intertwining operators between
      induced representations of G=O(p+1,q) and G'=O(p,q) corresponding to
      induction from maximal parabolic subgroup, parametrized each by one
      complex parameter. Already the special case q=1, which was extensively
      treated in [<a href="#bib-kobayashi2015symmetry">KS15</a>] by Toshiyuki Kobayashi and Birgit Speh,
      was shown to be interacting with numerous mathematical objects and
      theories (e.g. Knapp-Stein operators, de-Sitter spaces, harmonic
      analysis, branching laws of complementary series, etc.). For higher q
      one can immediately point out the special case (p,q)=(1,2) as being
      equivalent to finding invariant trilinear forms for representations of
      SL2, as one might see latter as SBOs of O(2,2)&gt;O(2,1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Of particular importance are so-called differential SBOs. In special
      case q=1 these were shown to coincide with Juhl's conformal equivariant
      operators (see [<a href="#bib-juhl2009families">Juh09</a>]). Moreover, based on the viewpoint
      introduced in [<a href="#bib-kobayashi2013differential">KP13</a>], one may see the Rankin-Cohen brackets
      (which in turn were originally introduced for the study of modular forms
      in number theory, but since then were seen to have connections with
      covariant quantization and ring structures on representations spaces) as
      differential symmetry breaking operators of O(2,2)&gt;O(2,1) branching.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of my work, I have been trying to study both differential
      SBO and the integral ones. The work can be divided into the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="auto-3"></a><h6>Project A. Geometry of flag manifold</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave complete classification of P'\G/P orbit decomposition of flag
      variety G/P of G under the action of P' (maximal parabolic subgroup of
      G'). That is, I was able to describe all orbits for every p,q and derive
      the closure relations. This information is extensively used in
      subsequent computations, as closed  subsets of G/P invariant under P'
      define a coarse invariant of a symmetry breaking operator. One should
      also mention that these orbit decompositions can be seen as
      generalizations of Iwasawa decomposition (if one takes G'=K, being
      maximal compact) and Bruhat decomposition (if one takes G'=G).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="auto-4"></a><h6>Project B. Construction of symmetry breaking
      operators</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      As shown in [<a href="#bib-kobayashi2015symmetry">KS15</a>], Schwartz kernel theorem tells us that
      SBO are characterized by their distribution kernels, which can then be
      associated to P'-covariant generalized functions on G/P flag manifold.
      Understanding the geometry of flag variety and using relative invariace
      (this being possible by results of Project A), I was able to construct
      explicitly these kernels with support in every possible set predicted by
      orbit decomposition for values of parameters regular enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="auto-5"></a><h6>Project C. Spectrum of symmetry breaking operators</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      As spherical vectors are mapped to spherical vectors under SBOs and
      spaces of spherical vectors are one-dimensional, one naturally becomes
      interested in multiplicity factors. Using integral formulae, I did some
      work in this direction with explicit expressions obtained in case when q
      is odd. The particular case of (p,q)=(1,2) was earlier obtained by
      Bernstein-Reznikov integrals [<a href="#bib-bernstein2004estimates">BR04</a>].
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="auto-6"></a><h6>Project D. Meromorphic continuation of symmetry breaking
      operators and normalization</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      As representations we are dealing with depend on a pair of complex
      parameters, so do the SBOs. Having constructed them for regular values
      of parameters, one then has to determine whether the extension to the
      whole parameter space is possible. Moreover, as for parameters regular
      enough the dependence turns out to be holomorphic, one finds himself
      using theory of generalized functions depending on holomorphic
      (meromorphic) parameter in order to carry out the extension. In doing
      so, poles usually occur and one is interested in determining their
      precise location and multiplicity, so to carry out the normalization,
      after which dependence on parameters becomes holomorphic. I was able to
      normalize all SBOs except of the regular one. Moreover, I investigated
      residues at poles and determined their support.

      <a id="auto-9"></a><h6>Problem A</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first challenging problem is to normalize and investigate kernel of
      regular SBO. Having normalized all singular SBOs and seeing them as
      residues of regular SBO (which is done with the help of residue formula
      one can write), with some more effort one should be able to normalize
      regular SBO as well. Moreover, structure of poles appears to be simple
      and similar to that of other operators. If done, this will let one to
      understand completely the structure of SBO space for every value of
      parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="auto-10"></a><h6>Problem B</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      After one completely understands the SBO, it is important to find
      functional identities between them. For case q=1 treated in [<a href="#bib-kobayashi2015symmetry">KS15</a>]
      this played a role in order to solve the next problem below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="auto-11"></a><h6>Problem C</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      After one completely understands the structure of SBO space and has
      functional identities, the latter can be used in order to get further
      information (e.g. composition series) about representations
      corresponding to induction from maximal parabolic. One may then
      investigate of how images/kernels of various SBOs match up with the
      composition series structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="auto-12"></a><h6>Research plan (middle and long term)</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      Branching problems and symmetry breaking operators are new and rich
      topics which allow for many long-term research projects, some of which I
      would like to undertake:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="auto-13"></a><h6>Problem D</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      One might try to challenge a more difficult setting, instead taking the
      induction from minimal parabolic subgroup, thus arriving at principal
      series. Computations appear to be more complicated, as the number of
      cosets P'\G/P increases with p and q, but still might be manageable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="auto-14"></a><h6>Problem E</h6>
    </p>
    <p>
      One might ask similar question for other pairs of reductive groups (as
      techniques of [<a href="#bib-kobayashi2015symmetry">KS15</a>] in fact apply to a wide range of
      problems). In particular, symmetry breaking between infinite-dimensional
      representations of general linear groups GL(n) and GL(n-1) and
      orthogonal O(n) and O(n-1) will be of interest related to study of
      automorphic forms in number theory (see [<a href="#bib-gan2011symplectic">GGP12</a>]).
