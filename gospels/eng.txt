I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.\\
And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)\\
How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.\\

For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.\\
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.\\
