Please, improve the following prompt to a Gemini model


```
{{ params.original_prompt }}
{{ utils.load_file(params.original_prompt_fn) }}
```

In particular,
1. Is any information contained in the prompt contradictory?
2. Any suggestions regarding the structure? Is my use of markdown consistent any facilitates model's "understanding"?
3. Can you suggest any other improvements?

Explain your changes, if any.
