A logic circuit realizing the function f has four inputs a, b, c, d.
The three inputs a, b, and c are the binary representation of the digits 0 through 7 with a being the most
 significant bit. 
The input d is an even-parity bit; that is, the value of d is such that a, b, c, and d 
always contains an even number of 1’s.
The function f has value 1 iff the input digit is *not* a prime number.

1. Draw a Karnaugh map for f.
1. Find all prime implicants of f.
1. Find all minimum sum of products for f.
1. Find all prime implicants of f’.
1. Find all minimum product of sums for f.

A logic circuit realizing the function f has four inputs a, b, c, d.
The three inputs a, b, and c are the binary representation of the digits 0 through 7 with a being the most
significant bit. 
The input d is an odd-parity bit; that is, the value of d is such that a, b, c, and d 
always contains an odd number of 1’s.
The function f has value 1 iff the input digit is divisible by 3.
