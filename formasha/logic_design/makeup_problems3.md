A combinational circuit is divided into two subcircuits N1 and N2 as shown in homework 4, problem 4. 
The truth table for N1 is given below. 
Assume that the input combinations 
`ABC = 100` and `ABC = 101`
never occur. 
Change as many of the values of D, E, and F to don't-cares as you can without changing the value of the 
output Z.

A | B | C | D | E | F
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1
0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0
