\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item NOT ok (SOP is wrong, POS is correct)
	\item NOT ok (what are essential minterms for $A'C$, $A'CD$ or $A'B'C$?)
	\item OK
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Problem 2 \score{10}{10}}
OK
\section*{Problem 3 \score{10}{10}}
OK, but why did you draw Carnaugh diagram two times?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item NOT ok ($ACD'$ is not prime as it is included in $ad'$; note that don't-cares are
		treated as 1s, see p.~140);
	\item NOT ok ($b c'd$ is prime, but not mentioned);

NOT ok (why $(a,b,c,d)=(0,1,0,0)$ yields 0? doesn't it correspond to number 2, which is prime?)
