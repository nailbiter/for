  \item NOT ok;
    what is the answer: $wy'+yw'x'+zw'x'+zwy$ or $wy'+wz+x'z+w'x'y$ (they are equivalent, but 
    where did you show it)?
    Also, none of these is equivalent to original expression (try $w=z=1,x=y=0$).
  \item OK

your answer is NOT optimal 
(hint: you can rewrite function as a sum of three and-expressions, each
one with two terms).
