OK, but where did you check the requirements for Integral Test (e.g. the fact that $f(x)$ is continuous, positive
and decreasing)?

Also, series \textit{converges} (not \textit{converge}).

Same as in previous problem.

Answer is wrong. For example, this series converges when $p=3/2<2$:
\begin{equation*}
	\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\ln n}{n^{3/2}}=
	\underbrace{\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{5/4}}}_{\mbox{convergent}} 
	\quad\cdot\underbrace{\frac{\ln n}{n^{1/4}}}_{
		\mbox{$<1$ for $n$ big}}
\end{equation*}

Note that the fact that reminder is less that $10^{-6}$ does NOT in general guarantee correctness to fifth decimal
places. For example, take\begin{equation*}
	a=1.9999999,\quad b=0.0000001<10^{-6},
\end{equation*}
but we still have $a+b=2$, so $a$ and $a+b$ have different fifth decimal sign.

good

good
\secscoreFootnote{46}{2}{10}{44,42}<++>
Answer is wrong. For example, for $c=0\le1$ series diverges.
