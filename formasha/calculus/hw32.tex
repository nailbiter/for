Directional derivative should be a single number. You have an expression.

Moreover, $f_x$ is wrong (should be $y^3-2x$).

Directional derivative should be a single number. You have a vector.

To indicate the error more precisely, the one-before-the-last expression you wrote is
\begin{equation*}
	\left( 6\mathbf{i} -9\mathbf{j}\right)
	\left( \frac{3}{5}\mathbf{i}+\frac{4}{5}\mathbf{j} \right)
\end{equation*}
this should indicate a \textit{scalar product}, which would indeed give you a single number. However, you
have interpreted this expression rather strangely\dots
\secscoreFootnote{22}{0}{10}{23,24}
$f_t$ is computed wrongly. Also, when you cite the Theorem (i.e. ``According to the Theorem'')<++>, please indicate the
number of Theorem and/or page of textbook.
