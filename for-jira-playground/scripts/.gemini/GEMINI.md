## Custom Tool for getting list of Jira sprints

I have a custom Python script to fetch a list of my Jira sprints.

- **Tool Name:** `list_sprints`
- **Purpose:** To get list of Jira scripts
- **Command:** `/usr/local/anaconda3/envs/base-with-altp/bin/python /Users/nailbiter/for/for-jira-playground/scripts/list-sprints.py`

When I ask you to "get a list of my Jira sprints" or something similar, you should use this tool.
