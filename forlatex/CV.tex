\section*{Working Experience \& Projects}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
2015--2015&{\bf Google Summer of Code 2015}\\& 
During the summer of 2015 I implemented a Tracking-Learning-Detection object tracking algorithm for the openCV library based
on the paper by Zdenek Kalal and his coauthors.
The implementation allows the user to select the object in the first frame and to have it tracked during the whole sequence.
The algorithm is known to be robust to occlusions and appearance changes.
\\
2013--2013&{\bf Google Summer of Code 2013}\\& 
I was a successful participant of Google Summer of Code 2013, the initiative, where students can have an opportunity to work on some
project for open-source company of their choice. I've submitted a proposal for Open Source Computer Vision Library (openCV) and it has passed
the competition. During the course of a project, I've implemented the generic numerical optimization module for openCV.\\
2013--2013&{\bf Pipeline for 3D models reconstruction}\\& 
Starting from my junior year I was working for Prof. Jong-Hong Chuang (Department of Computer Science, NCTU).
I was implementing the framework for the reconstruction of 3D models from the partial scans of a given body.
Pipeline included registration (that is, grouping partial scans together to get the set of
points describing the whole object), filtering and normal estimation (that is, clearing the
result from previous step and estimating normal for each point) and mesh reconstruction. I was doing mostly the first part (registration). My most notable achievement is the
naive implementation of a Chavdar Papazov’s ”Stochastic Optimization for Rigid Point
Set Registration” algorithm.
 \\
2010--2013&{\bf Trying to solve Schrödinger equation of helium}\\& 
This project is lead by Henryk Witek (Professor, Department of Applied Chemistry, NCTU). Professor Witek is interested in analytical (as opposed
to numerical) solution to the Schrödinger equation of the helium. Under the guidance of Professor Witek I have been helping to
investigate the problem using asymptotic expansion. Due to the fair amount of algebra involved, we have used Maple computer algebra system. Besides
the asymptotic expansion, it was attempted to attack the problem using the Lie theory.
\\
2012--2012&{\bf Privacy-Preserving Smart Meter system}\\&
This is the implementation of a paper by Dr. Hsiao-Ying Lin. The project is a
simulation in software of so-called privacy-preserving smart meter, a hypothetic hardware. This hardware, being installed in houses
can bill the electricity (network traffic, gas consumption etc.) in privacy-preserving manner, that is, without revealing the sensitive data about
per-month consumption to provider. Thus, it somehow allows seeing sums without seeing addends. This is achieved by using techniques from secure
aggregation, subfield of cryptography. I've implemented the project using openSSL library on C language in one semester.
. The code, documentation and all the rights belong to Hsiao-Ying Lin.
\\
2011--2012&{\bf "Privacy-Preserving Keyword Search" project.}\\
&
This project was done in partial fulfilment of the graduation requirements for the Computer Science department in NCTU. Thee project was done together with Sean Lin in
a team of two. Our advisors were Prof. Bao-Shuh Paul Lin (Chair Professor, Department of Computer Science, NCTU) and Dr.Hsiao-Ying Lin (Research Fellow, Information
and Communication Technology Laboratories, NCTU). Thee project was financed with
the Diamond Project Scholarship. Within one year we have delivered the prototype of
a system that was able to do the keyword search in privacy-preserving way. During
the project we have learned about important issues, such as cryptographic security and
pseudo-randomness.
\\
2010--2013&{\bf Calculus Tutor.}\\
&Starting from my sophomore year I was working as a Calculus Tutor at NCTU.\\
