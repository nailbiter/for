Our seminar with Taito and Naoya will commence from this Friday, I guess. We are hoping to start with Chapter II of Knapp.

As You remember, I've decided that it might be a good exercise to try to adapt the considerations of Your paper
to some other case. As of know, I'm thinking of $(G,G')=(SO(n,1),SO(n-1,1))$. I had the following plan, which I've
outlined in my previous email. Now, Tanaka-san kindly told me some fact (please, correct me, if I restate it wrongly), which I have yet
to fully understand. Nevertheless, it resolves some of questions I had.
\begin{fact}
	If $G'\subset $ are two linear Lie groups, both fixed by involution $\theta: g\mapsto {^tg^{-1}}$, then for $M,A,N$ and $M',A',N'$
	decompositions of $G$ and $G'$ respectively we have $M'=G'\cap M$, $A'=A\cap G'$, $M'=G'\cap M$ and the same for $P'=P\cap G'$.
\end{fact}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Try to clearly formulate all the assumptions that You had in Your paper about the pair $(G,G')$;
\begin{itemize}
	\item $G$ and $G'$ are both semi-simple,{\it true, as mentioned in Knapp.}
\item $G=P'N_-P$
\item $M'=M\cap G',\;A'=A\cap G',\;N'=N\cap G',\;P'=P\cap G'$ {\it true, by the fact}
\end{itemize}
\item Check whether the pair $(G,G')=(SO(n,1),SO(n-1,1))$ satisfies them;
\item Find parabolic subgroup and $MAN$ decomposition for $G$ and $G'$; {\it done by the fact}
\item Find real and complex flag varieties associated to $SO(n,1)$ (\textit{answer: $S^n$});
\item find the orbits of $P'\subset G'$ (parabolic subgroup of $G'$) on the flag variety of $G$ (we'll need this to classify
supports of kernel of operators, as in Kobayashi-Speh); {\it still working on this, but seems that decomposition is the same}
\item Find what these orbits correspond to under the parametrization of Bruhat cell by $\R^n$;
\item Set up the functional equations for kernels of symmetry breaking operators.
\end{enumerate}
Related to this plan, I have the following questions, which I'll try to answer myself:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is that right that the decomposition $MAN$ above and parabolic subgroup can all be computed purely on Lie algebra level (as, say
 $\mbox{Lie}(P)=\mathfrak{p}$)? (\textit{answer: no, as, say $P\neq\exp(\mathfrak{p})$});
\item How were equations for operator kernels found? To what extent do they depend on the underlying $(G,G')$ pair?;
\item What method was used to solve the equations (\textit{NB: has to do with Kobayashi-Pevzner paper})?;
\item How do we use knowledge about possible operator kernels?;
\item How answer to step 6 above was found in Kobayashi-Speh?
\end{enumerate}
Finally, answer to previously posed question. Suppose $\mathfrak{g}$ is some $n$-dimensional Lie algebra,
with basis $\mycbra{a_i}_{i=1}^n$ as a vector space and $n^3$ numbers $\mycbra{c_{ij}^k}_{i,j,k=1}^n$ are known, such that
\[\mysbra{a_i,a_j}=\sum_{k=1}^nc_{ij}^ka_k\]
Having them how can we:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find out the center $\mathfrak{z(g)}$ (\textit{A: Yes. In $O(n^3)$});
\item Find whether $\mathfrak{g}$ is semi-simple $\mathfrak{z(g)}$ (\textit{A: Yes. Check the degeneracy of Killing form. In $O(n^4)$});
\item Find Cartan subalgebra (\textit{Yes: see \cite{graaf}});
\item Find $\mathfrak{m},\mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{n}$ of $MAN$ decomposition;
\item Find the root system of $\mathfrak{g}$?
\end{enumerate}
One can compute $\mycbra{c_{ij}^k}_{i,j,k}$ for $\mathfrak{so(n,1)}$ (\textit{done, as: $X=I_{m,n}X^TI_{m,n}$,
which was kindly proven to me by Tanaka-san, this reduces to solving linear system}).

Having all these partial results I'm starting to be afraid that the case $(G,G')=(SO(n+1,1),SO(n,1))$ will be the same as $(O(n+1,1),O(n,1)$. Am
I doing something wrong?
